Source of **Rem**, simple clipboard sharing service build with **Flask** and **Vue.js** used to share snippets of code between my colleagues during university labs.

> ðŸŽ‰ Check it out live at [rem.bednarski.dev](https://rem.bednarski.dev/)!

## ðŸ“¦ Why build another Pastebin service?

Aside from learning experience, Using Rem has some advantages over other methods of sharing text:

-   **Number Only Codes**

Because of the temporality of shares only numbers are used for identifying them, which means It's easier to share them with people sitting next to you.

-   **No Login Required**

Using Rem doesn't require you to login unlike using a Facebook on which you have to do it on somebody's else computer.

<br>

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack

#### Backend
The servers side of Rem consists of the **Redis** database with a simple dockerized **Flask** app. **PyTest** with **Docker Compose** is used for basic functional testing on the GitHub Actions platform.

Metrics are gathered using self-hosted **TIG** stack and exceptions monitoring is handled by managed **Sentry** instance.

Rem is currently deployed on (Arm/Amd64) **Docker Swarm** cluster.

#### Frontend
As for the client-side, **Vue.js** with **Axios** is used for the logic of the **CSS Grid** heavy interface. **Sentry** is also used for monitoring exceptions.
